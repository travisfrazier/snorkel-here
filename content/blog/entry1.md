As you can see from the above video, Oahu is awesome! All of the locations meantioned here were also featured in the video, so get pumped! 
<br>
<br>
Here are the top spots for snorkeling on Oahu:

1. Sharks Cove
2. Makua Beach
3. Three Tables
4. Makaha Beach Park

### Sharks Cove

Sharks Cove sits along the north shore of Oahu. It's an amazing location with very interesting underwater typography. If you're into freediving or advanced snorkeling this is a must see spot. What Sharks Cove lacks in coral it makes up for with arches, tunnels, and amazing rock formations. (*if you're novice please don't try and swim through any tunnels here - you could easily drown)
<br>
<br>
There is no beach and it's very rocky. There is space to leave your belongings on the rocks. Sharks Cove should also be avoided during the winter months when the north shore is known for it's powerful swells. The waves during this time can make it very dangerious to explore the cove then.

### Makua Beach

Want to have the clearest water on the island, an amazing and secluded beach, the chance to see wild Spinner dolphins? That is what Makua Beach offers. 

It's on the least visited side of the island and is quite a drive away from most accomodations. Despite that, it's worth a visit.

### Three Tables

*Haec moenia pater* signataque urget, ait quies laqueo sumitque. Misit sit
moribunda terrae sequar longis hoc, cingebant copia cultros! Alis templi taeda
solet suum mihi penates quae. Cecidere *deo agger infantem* indetonsusque ipsum;

prodis pariterque sacra finibus, Sabinae. Fugarant fuerat, famam ait toto imas
sorte pectora, est et, procubuit sua Appenninigenae habes postquam.

### Makaha Beach Park

Spatiosa ferax iam sis ex quae peperit iacentes, grates rogat quae senserat nec
