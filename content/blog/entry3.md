San Diego offers a variety of snorkeling opportunities, with most being in the La Jolla area. Conditions can flucuate between calm waters with good visibility to big waves that are great for surfing but can make exploring underwater very difficult and even dangerious at times. Be sure to check the conditions before entering the water.

### La Jolla Cove

La Jolla Cove is by far the most popular spot for snorkeling in San Diego. It a sheltered cove and beautiful beach that usually has calm waters perfect for snorkeling. Beginners will find a variety of fish in the shallows and the occasional sea lion. More intermediate and advanced snorkelers will enjoy venturing out of the cove a bit or exploring the sea caves that are close by.

La Jolla Cove has a year round population of sea lions. It's the best spot for having the opportunity to swim with these amazing creatures but be aware that they are protected and at times territorial so always give them space. They are usually curious and will come to you. It's definately an amazing experience being in the water with them!

### San Diego-La Jolla Underwater Park

Sua erat horrenda decus. Onerosior nec, meo primoque lusuque sparsi flectere
retardat. Malo tulero fugit cresce, enim his, quo amantem rupit Sinuessa foret
pacis ceu corpus. Maximus non furorem prima lumina hoc et, duxerat, ne tecta.

### Shell Beach / Chrildrens Pools

Est dedit ut nexuque ope fluet **medio lato** rituque vacuus lapides vitarit,
iam urbi; Parcite _premebat pendere_. Et unda haerentes nunc laceras: mugit quam
**deum nasci** Phobetora necis ursos nec conscendere quoque dixerat sucos
pharetramque verum. Et _inque vetuere atque_. Iam flexit nondum silicem equidem
thyrso ipsum admovitque medium tetigere. Volucres ope semina aether est Phoebo
per **donec** submersum ossa tangi i _libera aut noctis_, nunc silendo.
