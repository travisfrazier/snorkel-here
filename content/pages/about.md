## Hello! We are Snorkel Here!

Welcome to Snorkel Here, a resource for finding the best snorkeling and freediving locations. We're dedicated to providing you with quality information, with a focus on: water clarity, what's below the surface, and location accessibility.
</br>
</br>
The web is filled with loads of information on locations to go that can sometimes be outdated and lacking. Quite fankly, a lot of the websites suck too! We are here to change that.

### Creators: Travis and Alisa Frazier

Snorkel Here is the brain child of creator Travis Frazier. An avid snorkeler and freediver himself he wanted to create a easy to use resource both in access to information and user experience.

We're excited for the future and becoming your go to resouce for your next underwater adventure!
