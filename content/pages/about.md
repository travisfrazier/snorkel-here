## Hello, We are Snorkel Here!

Welcome to Snorkel Here, a resource for finding the best snorkeling and freediving locations. We're dedicated to providing you with quality information, with a focus on: water clarity, what's below the surface, and location accessibility.
</br>
</br>
The web is filled with loads of information on locations to go that can sometimes be outdated and lacking. Quite fankly, a lot of the websites suck too! We are here to change that.

### Our Criteria for the Spots We Choose

#### Water Clarity
This is important. If you can't see then what's the point?!? Conditions can flucuate heavily from location to location. Depending on the time or year or even the day. Water clarity can range from very poor to excellent and we want to include spots that excel in this area.

### Creators: Travis and Alisa Frazier

Snorkel Here is the brain child of creator Travis Frazier and his wife Alisa. An avid snorkeler and freediver himself, he wanted to create a easy to use resource both in access to information and user experience.

We're excited for the future and becoming the go to resouce for your next underwater adventure!
